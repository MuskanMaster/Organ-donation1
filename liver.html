        <h2>What is Liver Donation?</h2>  
            <p>Liver donation is the process of giving part or all of your liver to someone whose liver is failing due to diseases like cirrhosis, hepatitis, or liver cancer. The liver is the only organ in the body that can regenerate, so a donor can typically live with part of their liver while the rest grows back. Liver donation can save lives by providing a healthy liver to someone in need, offering them a chance for survival and a better quality of life.</p>
        
        <h2>Why do some people need liver transplants?</h2>
            <p>People need liver transplants when their liver is damaged by diseases like cirrhosis, hepatitis, or liver cancer. These conditions cause the liver to stop working properly. A liver transplant can restore proper liver function and save lives. It helps the recipient live a longer, healthier life.</p>
    
        <h2>Why become a liver donor?</h2>
